# tree-traverse

This is a simple web app visualizing Tree Data structure traversal using React.

The user can create a tree by inserting nodes and then choose between different
traversals to see how they run in effect. As of now, Inorder, Preoder and
Postorder traversals are visualized. Features like search (DFS,BFS) will be
implemented soon.
